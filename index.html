		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="Times New Roman" color="black" size="3">
		My name is Jasmine, I am a mexican girl currecntly a senior in highschool. When I think of working and my own professional goals, I can imagine myself in a veriety of jobs as I would like to experience and learn for as I can. 
		In my case this would be when I find my true calling or at least something that I can imagine doing for a long time. My personal motivation is life itself. I am not someone who asks for much from life, as to me it is everything. I wouldn't 
		say that I am someone who lacks ambitions but I definitely have a "the journey is just as important as the destination" type of mindset. It may also be do to the fact that being so young makes me not want to limit myself, I mean I can't help
		but feel like life is barely starting for me. This makes me feel excited but it is also rather nerve wrecking. Regardless, I will try my hardest to focus on the now as I move through life.

   		<td>Piece 1: when making this piece, my goal was to create a collage of images that showcased my aesthetic. The theme for these specifc images are pink. First, an image of the city, there was something that I always found aesthetically pleasing about the city life,
		specifically how at night the colors made everything look futuristic and magical. Next to it, should be the opposite vibe as it's a picture of the sky however, the similar color ties into it pretty nicely and create an almost balance between the rest of the images that have more going on.</td>
   		<td>Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.</td>
   		<td>Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.</td>
